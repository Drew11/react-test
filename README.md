# Simple registration form

This is a simple project which is basically a registration form. The general idea is to see your code structure, code quality, and approach in general.

## Getting started

- Run `npm i && npm i -g json-server`
- Run `npm run dev` to start a client development server. By default available at `0.0.0.0:3001`
- Run `node server/app.js` to start a backend server. By default available at `0.0.0.0:3002`

That's it. Enjoy :)
